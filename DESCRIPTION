Title: Process N38 binary files from EM38-MK2 sensors
Version: 0.0.0.9004

Description: Interprets and decodes the '.N38' file format used by the 
    Geonics EM38-MK2 ground conductivity meter, as described in its 
	manual. Conversion to '.M38' format or an 'sf' point dataset is supported. 
	This package offers an alternative to the existing format conversion 
	software, which lacks a command-line interface and thus cannot be easily 
	used in a reproducible workflow. Note that only a limited subset of the 
	functionality available in the existing software has been replicated.
